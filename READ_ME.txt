Text-Based Stress Detector

Overview:

The Text-Based Stress Detector is a tool designed to analyze written communication and determine the presence of stress indicators. By leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques, machine learning algorithms, and real-time analysis, this application provides users with insights into their emotional state based on their text input. Really just a basic model with a frontend designed to service the model.

Features:

- User-Friendly Interface: The application features an intuitive and visually appealing interface, guiding users seamlessly through the stress detection process.

- Responsive Design: The stress detector is optimized for use across various devices and screen sizes, ensuring accessibility and usability for all users.

- Real-Time Analysis: Users receive immediate feedback on their stress levels as they type, empowering them with timely insights into their emotional state.

Getting Started:

To use the Text-Based Stress Detector, simply navigate to the app.py in the file, run the command on the terminal <python app.py>, then open the link provided there. Enter the text you wish to analyze in the provided input field, and the application will provide real-time feedback on the detected stress level.

Future Development:

We are continuously working to enhance the functionality and effectiveness of the Text-Based Stress Detector. Future updates may include:

- Better models with more gradients of stress.
- Personalized recommendations for stress management techniques.
- Longitudinal tracking and analysis features for monitoring stress trends over time.
